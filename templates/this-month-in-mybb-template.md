Once a PR is created against the [MyBB GitHub respository](https://github.com/mybb/mybb), it can be reviewed, and, if found satisfactory, "merged", in which case its changes are incorporated into the code of the official repository.

## MyBB on the web

{{A list of links to any interesting pages discussing MyBB outside of GitHub and the Community Forums, especially those that are new this month.}}

## The monthly dive-in

This month, we take a dive into issue #{{integer}}, [{{Issue title}}]({{hyperlink to GitHub issue}}), and its fix in PR #{{integer}}, [{{PR title}}]({{hyperlink to GitHub PR}}).

{{We would here take a notable or otherwise interesting issue, describe it, its effects, and its fix, including especially the rationale behind the fix and how/why it works, other solutions that were considered and rejected, and why the actual fix was preferred over them. Though titled a "dive-in", it would not be so lengthy that it failed to hold the reader's attention. The issue wouldn't necessarily be from that month; it could even be from years ago. One motivation behind this section would be to pique the interest of those who are not yet MyBB developers or even developers at all, to give them a taste of how intriguing/exciting/satisfying it can be to identify, analyse and then resolve a bug/issue/etc. This section might not be present every month; it might depend on time/motivation/inspiration.}}
