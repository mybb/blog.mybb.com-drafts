Some of you may be aware back in October 2016 with the release of MyBB 1.8.8 & Merge System 1.8.8 we ended the support for the current MyBB Merge System. The plan at that time was to rebuild the system from the ground up alongside the release of MyBB 2.0. As MyBB 2.0 has been put on hold indefinitely and a growing number of users are experiencing problems using the Merge System, were planning to reverse that decision and continue supporting the existing Merge System for the foreseeable future.

The current repository remains on GitHub and we will be using Git as normal to track issues and releases. The current plan is to release the next version with MyBB 1.8.23. A number of PR's have already been merged since the official end of support in 2016 including bug fixes for PHP 7.2's compatibility, support added for XenForo 2 . Please bear with us while we try to get on top of the issues reported some time ago and re-familiarising ourselves with the system again.

On a side note, Happy New Year to you all and we hope 2020 is a success.




Thanks,

MyBB Team
